# Country Comparison App

A command-line interface program for building comparative characteristics of countries of the world.
The functionality of the program provides comparison of countries according to some criteria,
as well as the creation of unions based on existing countries. Among the criteria there are such as population, area, gross domestic product and others.

The application is created on Java. The architecture of the application provides for execution within a single-user console application with a command line interface.
The application is built on the architecture of the MVC pattern. A json file is used as a storage location for subject area data.
Among third-party libraries, a library for parsing json files is used [json-simple](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/).
